api design guidelines I try to adhere to...

# The guidelines
1. Don't fight HTTP (leverage what HTTP does well, such as methods, URLs, so forth, and don't try to be clever [see #4])
2. Document for people (prose matters)
3. Understand Risk (design appropriate security)
4. Don't Be Clever (.. ok, don't be _too_ clever)
